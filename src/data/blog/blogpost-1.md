# Hello World: The Start of Something New

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This is the first official post of my personal blog—a space where I’ll be sharing my journey, my thoughts, and the occasional essay.

## Before the Storm

If we haven’t met yet, I’m Chaleb: a developer, blogger, and Army veteran. I’m passionate about technology, learning, and personal growth. I’ve been wanting to start a blog for a while now, and I’m excited to finally be taking the plunge. My story is a bit unconventional. Most people picture a straight line when they think about career paths, but mine has been more of a winding road. My journey into tech started in 2016, long before the military came into the picture. I worked as a cybersecurity architect, honing my skills in backend development, system security, and process optimization. It was an intense and rewarding chapter of my life that deepened my love for solving complex problems with technology.

## Army

Then, in 2022, I made the decision to join the military—a choice that shaped me in ways I never expected. Serving as an intelligence analyst was challenging and fulfilling, but it also came with its own set of hardships. After my service, I returned to my roots in tech, bringing with me a fresh perspective shaped by my time in uniform.

## The Journey Ahead

This blog is a reflection of all those experiences—my passion for technology, my military journey, and my drive to continuously learn and grow. I’ll be sharing insights from my life as a developer, tips on cybersecurity and backend development, and personal stories about navigating career transitions and big life changes.
